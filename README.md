## About the Video Course
Java 9 comes with a host of new features and new APIs with lots of ready-to-use components to build efficient and scalable applications. This course begins by introducing you to JDK 9’s latest additions and tools. You’ll learn about the latest performance features in Java 9, and see how to write microbenchmarks with JMH. After that, you’ll learn how to make the most of Java 9’s performance. You’ll discover how to develop highly concurrent applications with just-in-time compilation, segmented code, and ahead of time compilation.

Writing Java programs in a way that can be optimized by the compiler is not an easy task, but you’ll learn how to do this. The compiler can help you optimize your code in a very different way, and you’ll see how these optimizations affect the code written in Java 9. To create an efficient application, it’s imperative to test your app in the right way, so to write performance tests, we’ll use the JMH tool and you’ll learn how to leverage it.
